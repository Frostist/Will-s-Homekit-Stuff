# Will's Homekit Stuff
Just a README file with all my HomeKit links in it.

# Links
- [EEPROM Scanner](https://github.com/Frostist/EEPROM-Scanner) - Lets you scan your ESP8266 memory, to find out how many blocks are being used.
- [EEPROM Flash Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools) - Lets you flash your memory on ESP units, and upload code if need be.

# My Homekit devices

# Notes
- This is only for ESP8266
  - ESP01 (all unit types)
  - ESP8266 (all unit types)
- ESP32 units should work... but I haven't tested them with this code.
